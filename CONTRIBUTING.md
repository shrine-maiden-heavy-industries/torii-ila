## Use of Generative AI

This project explicitly does not allow any contributions that were generated in whole or in-part by large language models (LLMs), chatbots, or image generation systems. This ban includes tools, including but not limited to Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney, or Devin AI.

This policy covers all parts of the project, including, but not limited to code, documentation, issues, artworks, comments, discussions, pull requests, and any other contributions to Torii-ILA, without exception.

> [!NOTE]
> It is also recommended to avoid any and all AI tools when asking questions about Torii-ILA,
> prefer the documentation when available, as well as things such as the discussion forum, or IRC channel.
> These tools often fabricate plausible sounding information that is entirely incorrect, or often subtly
> incorrect and pass it off with confidence, thus misleading.
