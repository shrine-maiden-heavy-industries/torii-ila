class StreamInterface(Record):
	'''
	A very simple record implementing a unidirectional stream interface.

	Parameters
	----------
	data_width : int
		Stream width in bits.

	Attributes
	----------
	ready : Signal, recv
		Indicates that the receiver will accept the data at the next active
		clock edge.

	first : Signal, send
		Indicates that the data is the first of the current packet.

	last : Signal, send
		Indicates that the data is the last of the current packet.

	payload : Signal(data_width), send
		The data to be transmitted.

	valid : Signal(valid_width), send
		Indicates  ``data`` is part of this transfer.

	'''

	ready: Signal

	def attach(self, iface: 'StreamInterface', omit: set = set()):
		'''
		Attach to a target stream.

		This method connects our ``valid``, ``first``, ``last``, and ``data`` fields to
		the downstream facing ``stream``, and their ``ready`` field to ours.

		This establishes a connection to where we are the originating stream, and ``stream``
		is the receiving stream.

		.. code-block::

			self.data  -> stream.data
			self.valid -> stream.valid
			self.first -> stream.first
			self.last  -> stream.last
			self.ready <- stream.ready

		Parameters
		----------
		stream : torii_ila._stream.StreamInterface
			The stream we are attaching to.

		omit : set[str]
			A set of additional stream fields to exclude from the tap connection.
			(default: {})

		Receive from target stream.

		This method connects the ``valid``, ``first``, ``last``, and ``data`` from ``stream`` to ours,
		and our ``ready`` field to theirs.

		This establishes a connection to where ``stream`` is the originating stream, and we are the receiving
		stream.

		.. code-block::

			self.data  <- stream.data
			self.valid <- stream.valid
			self.first <- stream.first
			self.last  <- stream.last
			self.ready -> stream.ready

		This function is effectively the inverse of :py:meth:`attach`, in fact, it's implementation
		is just:

		.. code-block:: python

			stream.attach(self, ...)

		It is provided as a more logical way to connect streams.

		Parameters
		----------
		stream : torii_ila._stream.StreamInterface
			The stream to attach to this stream.

		omit : set[str]
			A set of additional stream fields to exclude from the tap connection.
			(default: {})
